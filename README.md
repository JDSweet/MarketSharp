# MarketSharp

The goal of this project is to create a C# general purpose simulation of market mechanics that is lightweight, extensible, flexible, and simple/unbloated enough to be useful in multiple different contexts (though this system was primarily orginally developed to serve as the backbone of an economy system in a strategy game).

The project is licensed under the MIT license.
